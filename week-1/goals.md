= CSCI 3155 Spring 2019 - Week 1

== Lecture 1: Introduction to Course and Scala Setup

Lecture Outline

=== Part 1

- Course logistics: Moodle signup, basic ground rules: assignments, exams, take questions.
- Motivate what programming languages offer and what this course is about.
- Axes along which we try to understand programming languages:
- Compiled vs. Interpreted : this is a traditional artifacts. Languages these days compile to virtual machine bytecodes such as JVM, .NET bytecode, LLVM bytecode.
- Strong Typed vs. Weakly Typed: Illustrate behavior using languages like C++, Python, Java and OCAML.
- Static Type Checking vs. Runtime Type Checking: Illustrate what this means.
- Object System: Some languages like Scala are entirely oriented around objects. C on the other hand is not object oriented. Java and C++ are somewhere in between. What do objects offer us? Talk a little about generics.
- Concurrency: many programming languages are targetted around specific notions of parallel computation.
- Domain Specific Languages and APIs.


=== Part 2

- Scala language introduction.
- Ask them to get setup using the virtual machine, native install of
scala/IntelliJ and/or coding.csel.io
- Basic types in scala: numbers, strings etc.
- Hello world program in scala.
- Immutables.

== Interrim Between Lectures

- Students should have explored some basic scala programs on their own.


== Lecture 2 : Scala

Lecture Outline

- Basics of Scala: expressions, functions, control loops, lists, maps, ...
- Walk them through 10-15 examples. Make them solve problems on their own.
- TODO: Synchronize on problems and make up notebook in advance of class for students to access.
